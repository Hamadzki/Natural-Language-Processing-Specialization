# Natural Language Processing Specialization

This repository contains projects and assignments completed as part of the **Natural Language Processing Specialization** offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing). The specialization consists of four courses that dive deep into the fundamentals and advanced techniques in NLP.

## üèÜ Key Takeaways

Throughout this specialization, I developed a strong foundation in Natural Language Processing and gained hands-on experience with state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Some of the key concepts and skills I acquired include:

- **Text Classification**: Applied models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for tasks such as sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
- **Vector Spaces and Similarity**: Explored how to represent text as vectors and perform document searches and machine translation.
- **Probabilistic Models**: Worked with probabilistic approaches such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for tasks like POS tagging, autocorrect, and autocomplete.
- **Word Embeddings**: Used embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe to represent words in a vector space and capture semantic relationships.
- **Neural Networks in NLP**: Built neural network models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Applied attention-based models to Neural Machine Translation, Text Summarization, and Question Answering systems.
- **Advanced Applications**: Developed real-world NLP applications like chatbots and question-answering systems using cutting-edge models.
